            <td bgcolor="black" style="color:white">Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and
                ODI cricket for the Indian national
                team. A former captain in all formats of the game, Kohli retired from the T20I format following India's
                win at the 2024 T20 World Cup.
                India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To
                meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was
                in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most
                consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his
                own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.


                This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers
                especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at
                No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way to end up as
                India's most successful Test captain.
